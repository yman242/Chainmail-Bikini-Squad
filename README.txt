This game was a group effort between Brandon Anderson and myself while we worked with Loogaroo. I did most of the character work, including their special powers, and he did most of the level creation. The rest we split. None of the good art is ours.

This game was made using Flash Develop and Flixel.

This game has no end goal at the moment and is currently a prototype.

The one with the upper green square can glide and bounce other characters up if another character jumps unto her green square.

The one without a green square can jump highest.
